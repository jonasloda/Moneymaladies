        <h1 class="about-title">CREATING MONEY</h1>

        <p><span class="dropcap">I</span>f lending temporarily moves money from saver to borrower, then banking performs an altogether different function: it calls new money into being. Thus, if there is a willingness for someone to incur debt and a corresponding readiness for a bank to extent credit, money can be called forth as if by alchemy, rendering banks not lenders of money, but manufactories of money (See <a href="https://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/townsend-a-history-of-banking-in-all-the-leading-nations-vol-2" target="_blank">Macleod, 1896</a>). In this capacity, the bank gives people and businesses <em>“the means of purchasing goods without at the same time diminishing the money-spending power of somebody else”</em> (<a href="https://cdn.mises.org/prices_and_production_and_other_works.pdf" target="_blank">Hayek, 2008</a>, p. 290).

            <p>To understand how this arcane craft of money creation works, we can begin by examining the process of discounting a bill of exchange, a practice emblematic of early banking. Before proceeding, however, it is worth clarifying what a bill of exchange is, particularly as its form and function may be unfamiliar to some readers.</p>
            
            <p>Legally defined in the Bills of Exchange Act (<a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Vict/45-46/61" target="_blank">1882</a>), a bill of exchange is <em>“is an unconditional order in writing, addressed by one person to another, signed by the person giving it, requiring the person to whom it is addressed to pay, on demand or at a fixed or determinable future time, a sum certain in money”</em>. Put differently, a bill of exchange is a written order from one party to another, directing the payment of a specific sum of money on a future date, commonly used in commercial trade to defer payment between buyers and sellers. In this capacity, a bill of exchange can be understood as a form of loan agreement: by deferring payment, the seller is—as a matter of substance—lending the buyer the money needed to acquire the goods, using the bill of exchange as way to formalise and enforce the obligation to repay.</p>
                
            <p>For this bill to be valid, it must specify who does what, and it therefore assigns three roles, namely <em>the drawer</em>, <em>the drawee</em>, and <em>the payee</em>. The drawer is the person who issues and signs the bill, specifically the seller of goods. The bill is addressed to the drawee, who is the buyer of goods, and who, once they accept the bill, becomes legally obligated to pay the stated amount on the agreed future date. And the payee is the person entitled to receive the payment when it becomes due. Often, this is the drawer, though the right to receive payment can be transferred to a third party.</p>
                
            <p>Now, to see how this plays out in practice, consider the following example. A trader acquires a shipment of goods from a textile merchant, with payment postponed by mutual agreement for ninety days, enough time for the trader to sell the goods and use the proceeds to repay the merchant. But the merchant may have little desire to wait, as cash on hand can be used to replenish inventory, pay laborers, or meet other short-term obligations. Rather than wait for money to arrive at the end of the term, the merchant therefore draws up a bill of exchange addressed to the trader, instructing that payment be made on the agreed date. Provided the trader consents to sign the bill when presented, the merchant then takes this bill to a third party—say, a bank—who agrees to purchase it for cash at a discount. The merchant receives immediate funds and the bank acquires the right to collect the full amount from the trader when the ninety days are up Thus, the merchant assumes the role of the drawer, the trader is designated as the drawee, and the bank becomes the payee.</p>
                
                <p>For the bank, the appeal of buying the bill lies in the profit to be made through discounting. By purchasing it below face value, the bank acquires a legal claim on a fixed sum due at a known date, earning a margin equal to the difference between the purchase price and the amount received at maturity. That difference is the bank’s reward for parting with money now in exchange for money later and reflects the time value of money, much like interest<sup class="footnote" data-footnote="Interest and discount are two ways of measuring the same return over time: interest is paid after loan origination, while discount is deducted upfront from the amount advanced.">1</sup>, plus a premium for the risk of nonpayment.</p> 
                    
                <p>What really matters for our purposes, however, is not so much <em>why</em> the bank agrees to buy the bill from the merchant, but <em>how</em> it pays for it. While it could, in principle, draw down its cash reserves to make the payment, that is not what actually happens. Instead, it pays by issuing its own liabilities, either in the form of notes or demand deposits, which is to say, it creates the money it uses to pay, a process know as <a href="an-accounting-view-of-money.html" target="_blank"><em>payment by issuance</em></a>. Part of what gives the bank’s liabilities their moneyness is the fact that they are redeemable on demand into coined metal at par value. Said differently, the merchant, in accepting a deposit in exchange for the bill, does so with the assurance that the deposit can be withdrawn in cash at any time, without loss.</p>
                    
                <p>Crucially, however, the merchant need not actually redeem the deposit. Instead, the deposit may be transferred onward as payment by instructing the bank to debit the merchant’s account and credit another’s. In this way, deposits can move from one party to another, not because anyone mistakes it for coin, obviously, but because each successive holder trusts that it could be redeemed at par if desired. The promise of convertibility thus underwrites the acceptability of deposits and, together with their transferability, allows them to function as money in their own right.</p>

            <p>So, when issuing money, what the bank is really doing is exchanging one IOU for another: it accepts a promise of future payment from the trader and issues, in return, a promise of its own to the merchant, that is, a deposit payable on demand. This act of maturity transformation converts a future-dated claim into present purchasing power.</p> 
                
            <div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 50px;">
                <img src="Billeder/bill of exchange.png" alt="Bill of Exchange" width="600px">
            </div>            

            <p>But maturity transformation alone does not account for the creation of money. Money is created because the bank issues a new deposit without holding an equivalent amount of cash in reserve. If every dollar of deposits were backed by a dollar of cash, the overall money supply would remain unchanged. That would amount to <em>full-reserve banking</em>—or <em>shadow banking</em>, for that matter—both of which involve no money creation, only the lending of existing funds<sup class="footnote" data-footnote="As Gabor and Vestergaard (2016) have pointed out, this is not entirely true for European universal banks. Such institutions issue shadow money (that is, repo liabilities) alongside deposits. By pledging securities as collateral, they raise funds in wholesale markets and provide counterparties with highly liquid, money-like claims. In this way, universal banks extend money creation into the shadow banking realm.">2</sup>. Banking, as I here use the term, therefore operates on a fractional-reserve basis, meaning that banks hold only a small portion of reserves relative to their total deposit liabilities.</p>

            <p>That banks can issue deposits beyond their coin holdings reflects the reality that depositors typically do not redeem their deposits all at once. Instead of converting their deposits into coin, depositors opt to save or make payments by instructing the bank to transfer the balance to another account. In this way, the deposit remains within the bank, moving from one account to another without triggering an outflow of reserves. So long as withdrawals remain modest and predictable, the bank can therefore maintain only a fraction of reserves relative to their outstanding liabilities, meaning the system functions not because every deposit is backed by coined metal, but because only a small portion is ever redeemed at any given time<sup class="footnote" data-footnote="Demand deposits can be seen as having a dual nature stemming from the fact that only a portion of
                deposits constitutes actual debt liabilities requiring reserve coverage. The remaining portion serves as a
                source of income for the issuing bank, which is equivalent to equity in accounting terms. Consequently,
                demand deposits can be seen as a form of hybrid instrument comprising both debt-deposits and equity-deposits
                (Bossone et al. 2018)">3</sup>. This also means that the extent to which banks can issue money is not unlimited, but is constrained by the community’s willingness to hold deposits, what George Selgin, the free banking economist, refers to as <em>the real demand for deposits</em> (<a href="https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/2024-03/working-paper-80.pdf" target="_blank">2024</a>). Still, this oversimplifies matters somewhat, as banking takes place not within a single institution but across a network of banks, a fact that complicates the dynamics of redemption, and to which we will return shortly.
            </p>

            <p>But first, I shift the focus to modern banking, which preserves the core logic of monetising debt but differs from its early counterpart in two crucial respects: first, money is now issued before the trade takes place, not after, and second, the bank’s profit arises from interest, not discount. For present purposes, only the former is relevant.</p>

            <p>Modern banks facilitate trade between buyers and sellers by issuing money through the extension of credit, typically to buyers, though there are exceptions<sup class="footnote" data-footnote="In trade finance the sequence can reverse. Here the seller (or supplier) may approach the bank after goods are shipped, receiving an advance against receivables. These arrangements preserve the older pattern in which money issuance follows, rather than precedes, the commercial exchange.">4</sup>. They do so by accepting the buyer’s promise to repay the principal along with any agreed-upon interest, recording this promise as an asset on its books, and crediting a deposit in return, thereby furnishing the borrower with the money needed to set the transaction in motion. Thus, money is summoned prior to transacting, empowering the buyer to initiate the trade, rather than serving as a post-sale payment to the seller, as was customary in earlier banking practice. Revisiting the example from before, it is therefore the trader, not the merchant, who now approaches the bank, not to liquidate a bill, but to obtain the purchasing power necessary to initiate the trade. The result is a mutual relationship of indebtedness between borrower and bank, what Stefano Sgambati (<a href="https://openaccess.city.ac.uk/id/eprint/15914/8/Rethinking_banking%20_Debt_discounting_and.pdf" target="_blank">2016</a>), a scholar of money and international finance, calls a <em>debtor-debtor relation</em>: The borrower assumes a long-term obligation to repay the loan, whereas the bank undertakes an immediate obligation to settle any payment instructions drawn against the deposit.</p>

            <div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 50px;">
                <img src="Billeder/debtor-debtor.png" alt="A debtor-debtor relation" width="600px">
            </div>            

            <p>This relation, however, is inherently short-lived. The borrower does not incur debt merely to let the borrowed funds sit unused, as the interest payments would result in negative cash flow. Deposits therefore <em>“only come into existence the moment a payment is made”</em> (<a href="https://www.fclar.unesp.br/Home/Pesquisa/GruposdePesquisa/cemonde/graziani-1990---the-theory-of-the-monetary-circuit.pdf" target="_blank">Graziani 1989</a>, p. 11), implying the involvement of a receiving party, or payee, in the loan process. Suppose, for instance, a borrower takes out a loan to purchase a car from a dealer. The borrower becomes the payor, the car dealer the payee, and the newly created deposit is transferred from the former to the latter. Once this transfer occurs, the bank is no longer indebted to the payor but to the payee, while the payor remains indebted to the bank. Thus, the initial debtor–debtor relation between payor and bank dissolves, giving way to two distinct creditor–debtor relations: the payor as debtor to the bank, and the bank as debtor to the payee. In this respect, modern banking is identical to its early counterpart: the bank stands between two parties, the buyer and the seller, lending money to the former and owing money to the latter.
                
            <p>By recording the payor as its debtor and the payee as its creditor, the bank inserts itself between the two parties, thereby intermediating the transaction. In doing so, it records the payee’s contribution to the economy—selling the car—alongside the payor’s share in consuming it. Viewed through the lens of the account view, the payor thus assumes an obligation to provide services equal in value to the car acquired, while the payee acquires the right to command goods of equal value in return. In this capacity, banks can be thought of as managing the virtual ledger of the economy—using <em>promise-of-work accounting</em>—constantly updating it as they facilitate payments. That is, they record what individuals and businesses add to the economic process and what they draw from it, assigning the economic rights and obligations that follow. In this sense, banks are indeed, as Schumpeter (<a href="https://books.google.dk/books?id=-OZwWcOGeOwC&printsec=frontcover&hl=da&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false" target="_blank">1934</a>, p. 74) wrote, <em>“the ephor[s] of the exchange economy”</em><sup class="footnote" data-footnote="Ephor comes from the Greek éphoroi, meaning overseers.">4</sup>.</p> 
            
            <div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 50px;">

            </div>            

            <p>But if money issuance initiates the exchange relation, allowing one party to acquire goods or services from the market before having contributed any in return, then money depletion concludes it, as the borrower returns to the market commodities equal in value to what was taken. In other words, the borrower can bring the debt relation to a close only by re-entering the market as a seller, producing the revenue needed for repayment, at which point credit has fulfilled its purpose and stops to exist. The money supply, said differently, shrinks: The loan is canceled as an asset on the bank’s books, together with the liability surrendered in repayment. Thus, the bank’s balance sheet contracts, and with it, the temporary money supply that had been brought into existence, a process known as <a href="an-accounting-view-of-money.html" target="_blank"><em>payment by set-off</em></a>.</p> 

            <p>Should the borrower fail to meet their obligation to supply the market with a sufficient quantity of goods or services, rendering them incapable of fulfilling their debt obligations, the money supply will shrink regardless. The borrower’s default is absorbed by the bank as it records the unpaid loan as a loss on its asset side, translating into a reduction of its equity. The erosion of equity restricts the bank's ability to disburse salaries and dividends, in effect limiting the flow of money back into the economy at a rate equivalent to the loss incurred. Hyman Minsky (<a href="http://digamo.free.fr/minsky86.pdf" target="_blank">1986</a>, p. 256) therefore makes the point that <em>“a bank, by accepting a debt instrument, agrees to make specified payments if the debtor will not or cannot”</em>.</p>
                
            <p>In either case—whether through repayment or default—deposits exist only for a brief moment of time. Over the course of their transitory existence, and insofar as debt obligations are successfully met, they facilitate two distinct economic processes, at least so long as bank credit is directed toward the circulation of commodities rather than the capitalization and trading of assets. The first is exchange, characteristic of modern banking, in which one commodity is ultimately traded for another, with money serving as the medium that allows borrowers to obtain goods today and repay with different goods tomorrow<sup class="footnote" data-footnote="This also includes productive activities: using credit, firms acquire the commodity of labor and, in return, provide goods or services to the market. Thus, one commodity is exchanged for another, using bank credit as the medium">5</sup>. The second is trading, characteristic of early banking, in which money is advanced to traders who acquire goods in cheap markets in order to transport and resell them in dear markets. In the former, banking bridges the temporal gap between production and consumption; in the latter, it bridges spatial and temporal distances between markets. Yet despite their differences, both processes unfold in the same pattern: banks expand the money supply to set economic activity in motion, and once that activity has run its course and debts are repaid, the money supply contracts. Or said differently, the money supply increases as goods are drawn out of the market by those who have not yet supplied any, and it contracts when they subsequently return something of equal worth.</p> 
                
            <p>This cyclical movement is like ebb and flow, what the scholars of the Banking School termed <em>efflux</em> and <em>reflux</em>: money is brought into circulation as loans are granted and returns to the banks as those loans are repaid. In this way, the stock of money is not fixed but elastic, expanding and contracting in step with the demands of trade. Notably, the reflux side of this process was central to the Banking School, who set forth the <em>law of reflux</em>. Formulated in the heat of the nineteenth-century debates between the Currency and Banking Schools, it was advanced most forcefully by John Fullarton (<a href="https://books.google.dk/books?id=rcUZAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&hl=da#v=onepage&q&f=false" target="_blank">1845</a>) as a rebuttal to fears of over-issue. Where the Currency School insisted that bank credit, if not strictly backed by bullion, would cause an inflationary supply of money, the Banking School replied that such credit was self-limiting:<em>"it is not so much by convertibility into gold, as by the regularity of the reflux, that any redundance of the bank-note issues is rendered impossible"</em> (<a href="https://books.google.dk/books?id=rcUZAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&hl=da#v=onepage&q&f=false" target="_blank">Fullarton, 1845</a>, p. 67). Any issue beyond the needs of trade would inevitably flow back to its source, returning to the banks and canceling itself out.</p> 
                
            <p>A related and more modern formulation of this mechanism is found in the monetary circuit theory. Developed by the Italian economist Augusto Graziani (<a href="https://www.fclar.unesp.br/Home/Pesquisa/GruposdePesquisa/cemonde/graziani-1990---the-theory-of-the-monetary-circuit.pdf" target="_blank">1989</a>), it depicts a closed economy consisting of banks, firms, and wage-earners. Within this model, a production cycle commences once firms have secured loans from banks. This leads to an increase in the supply of money—a process Graziani calls <em>initial finance</em>—enabling them to engage in productive activities. Assuming these firms represent one consolidated and integrated sector, their only financial outlay is the payment of wages to employees, who, upon receiving salaries, are faced with three choices: They can spend their earnings on goods produced by the firms, invest in securities issued by the firms, or keep the money as idle balances. If they opt to spend or invest the totality of their income, all money is redirected back to the firms, enabling them to fulfill their debt obligations to the banks. Once the loans are repaid, the money supply—along with bank balance sheets—contracts, a process Graziani terms <em>final finance</em>. With this, both the production cycle and the monetary circuit reach their conclusion.</p>   
                
            <p>Yet, as useful as these models are for illustrating the basic rhythm of money issuance and depletion, they remain somewhat stylised. They presume that credit is extended primarily for circulating commodities, but this is far from an adequate rendering of contemporary banking practice. Today, a large share of banking is not directed toward exchanging or trading commodities, but toward purchasing and trading yield-bearing assets, above all, real estate, equities, and debt instruments, all of which provide investors with unearned income, understood here as the accumulation of economic rights absent any corresponding contribution to commodity production. In effect, investors take without giving. This will be the focus of a forth-coming chapter, where we will also dive into how the efflux and reflux mechanisms of bank credit diverge from the idealized form presented in Graziani's circuit model. But for now, the task is to further develop an understanding of finance, which, as a next step, involves understanding the concept of liquidity.</p>
