        <p><span class="dropcap">F</span>inance is an oddly elusive concept. What, after all, do we mean by it? When pressed to explain it, clarity often gives way to ambiguity. Perhaps for this very reason, the literature leaves it largely undefined: One can browse through countless books and papers on finance without encountering a single attempt to say what it is, as if the concept is so self-explanatory that it needs no introduction or as if it is too abstract to permit one.</p>
            
            <p>In contemporary discourse finance refers to a vast and heterogeneous assemblage of practices, things, and entities. It encompasses the fiscal policies of a nation-state, the budgeting of households and companies, the provision and use of money, trading of assets, and strategies for managing risk. It spans a range of instruments, from conventional securities like shares and bonds to more complex ones such as derivatives, structured products, and repurchase agreements. And it enlists a cast of institutions as diverse as sovereign treasuries, banks, asset managers, payment processors, dealers, rating agencies, and exchanges. Confronted with such a wide range of practices and things, it is therefore prudent to ask: where does finance begin and where does it end?</p>
            
        <p>Bringing clarity to ambiguity, I will propose a framework for understanding finance, one that inevitably risks being somewhat narrow, perhaps too narrow in the eyes of some. But defining finance inevitably means establishing the boundaries of what falls within its scope and what does not. After all, the act of definition is, by its very nature, an act of exclusion.</p> 
            
            <p>Before doing so, however, it is worth pausing to consider where the concept of finance stems from. Not only because the term’s origins may offer insight into its conceptual evolution but also because it may provide a foundation upon which a contemporary definition can be built. So that's where we begin.</p>
        <!-- Section: THE END OF FINANCE -->
<h3>THE BEGINNING AND END OF FINANCE</h3>

        <p>In his dissertation, <em>The Evolution of Latin finis into Old French</em>, Joseph Podgurski (<a href="https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/006579423" target="_blank">1941</a>) traced the origins of <em>finance</em> back to the Old French verb <em>finer</em>—itself derived from <em>finis</em>—meaning simply <em>to end</em> or <em>to finish</em>. And in its earliest form, finance meant just that. In medieval literature, we accordingly find the term not in the context of markets or moneylenders, but as a word used to describe the act of bringing things to a close. For instance, in a 13th-century poem by Jean Priorat (ed. <a href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433075802961&seq=7" target="_blank">Ulysse Robert, 1897</a>), the author concludes a passage on the Roman legions with the words <em>“Des légions ai fait finance”</em>, meaning <em>"I have made an end of the legions</em>". Here, finance marks the end of a section. A related usage appears in <em>La Clef d’Amors</em> (ed. <a href="https://archive.org/details/laclefdamors00dout/page/n7/mode/2up" target="_blank">Auguste Doutrepont, 1890</a>), where a 13th-century anonymous poet writes, <em>“que de son mesfet quert finance”</em>, meaning <em>“he seeks to make an end of his misdeed”</em>. Here, again, finance is invoked to signify the act of bringing something to an end, this time ethical rather than literary. In these early attestations, then, finance denoted closure.</p>
            
        <p>This changed somewhat in the 14th century. The word finance no longer implied a mere ending, but had begun to refer more specifically to the settlement of disputes or obligations, often through monetary means. We find one example in the works of medieval historian Jean Froissart (ed. <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/72189/pg72189.txt" target="_blank">Gaston Raynaud, 2023</a>) who employed the term in reference to ransom payments, that is, sums of money paid to secure the release of knights who had been captured in battle. He writes: <em>"Si demora messires Guillaumes de Nielle prisonniers devers les Englès, et puis se mist il à finance, et retourna en France"</em>, meaning <em>"Sir Guillaume de Nielle remained a prisoner of the English, and later ransomed himself and returned to France"</em>. The word finance thus took on its first distinctly modern form, referring to the way obligations or disputes were settled monetarily. Yet the term also came to denote the funds themselves. Thus in Mélusine (<a href="https://archive.org/details/romandemelusine0000jdar/page/8/mode/2up" target="_blank">2003</a>), a 14th-century prose romance, we read <em>“et voulons bien que chascun sache que nous avons finance assez pour paier noz gens”,</em> meaning <em>“we wish everyone to know that we have enough money to pay our men”</em>. Here, finance meant money itself, the asset with which obligations were settled.</p>   
        <p> Over the following centuries, the term continued to evolve, taking on meanings increasingly aligned with systems of governance and public administration. By the 15th century, finance was no longer limited to personal or transactional settlements, but had entered the realm of statecraft, referring to the king’s income or the money managed by royal officials. A telling example comes from Philippe de Commynes (<a href="https://archive.org/details/mmoiresdephili02commuoft/page/586/mode/2up?q=finances" target="_blank">1840</a>), a French statesman, who wrote about the necessity for a king to <em>“renger ses finances”</em>, meaning to <em>“arrange his finances”</em>. Elsewhere, Commynes also referred to the <em>“gens des finances”</em>, traslating to <em>“men of finance”</em>, the royal officials charged with overseeing the king’s revenues and expenditures. In this way, finance came to denote the entire apparatus of fiscal administration, encompassing both the crown’s resources and the institutions responsible for managing them.</p>

        <p>Though centuries have passed, these pre-modern meanings assigned to the word continue to shape what we understand by finance today. When we speak of public finance, we echo Commynes' idea of a ruler <em>"arranging his finances"</em> with the term now covering everything a government does to raise, allocate, and account for revenue, such as taxing, borrowing and budgeting. Conversely, when we talk about private finance, including meeting payroll obligations or servicing a mortgage, we repeat the older medieval notion of using money to settle obligations.</p>
            
            <p>Now, it is this earlier and more elementary meaning of the word that will inform my understanding of finance, albeit in a slightly altered form, one inspired by the Italian economists Massimo Amato and Luca Fantacci, according to whom finance is the act of bringing obligations to an end (<a href="https://dokumen.pub/the-end-of-finance-1nbsped-0745651100-9780745651101.html" target="_blank">2011</a>). Thus, I take finance to refer to a relation between two parties, one that is initiated with the explicit understanding that it will be brought to an end. More specifically, finance here denotes a creditor-debtor-relation: It is the act of receiving a sum of money today in exchange for a promise to repay a defined sum tomorrow.</p>
            
            <p>This creditor–debtor relation is first and foremost a legal one. When credit is extended, whether in the form of a regular loan, deferred payment, or a bond, the debtor incurs a legally binding obligation to repay, and the creditor acquires a corresponding legal claim to repayment. In this sense, finance, as I use the term, refers to a legal relation between two identifiable parties, created with the explicit expectation of closure, meaning the balance between creditor and debtor will eventually be restored. As Fantacci (<a href="https://www.degruyterbrill.com/document/doi/10.1515/ael-2013-0017/html" target="_blank">2013, p. 338</a>) writes: <em>"The payment is the end of finance, understood both as its termination and as its purpose"</em></p>

        <p>But finance is also an economic relation, one between the debtor and the world: it is the granting of economic rights in advance of one’s own contribution to the market, accompanied by an obligation to return commodities of equal value in the future. In this sense, finance rearranges the temporal order of the classical exchange sequence, C–M–C. In the C–M–C sequence, commodities are initially sold to the market, and subsequently bought (<em>sell–then–buy</em>). Finance inverts this sequence by enabling households and firms to draw commodities from the market before any have been supplied (<em>buy–then–sell)</em>. Finance, in this sense, carries an obligation to give back to the market something of equal value to what was taken. So, if money represents economic rights, then finance representes their counterforce, namely <em>economic obligations</em>: just as the money asset grants its holder the right to draw commodities from the market, a debt obligation binds the borrower to deliver commodities back to it.</p>
            
        <p>This, at least, holds true for private finance, where the debtor is a household or firm. The picture changes somewhat when we turn to public finance, where the debtor is the state. Here, too, the state borrows money, and here, too, a creditor–debtor relation is established. But unlike private borrowers, the state is not compelled to return commodities to the market in order to repay. Instead, it discharges its obligations by issuing new money. Thus, public debt does not bind the state to repayment in kind, insofar as it can use its authority to create economic rights, that is, money.<sup class="footnote" data-footnote="Because the creation of new money increases the volume of economic rights, the state will often seek to offset this by revoking rights already in existence. This can be done in one of two ways. Through taxation, where households and firms surrender part of their economic rights. Or through bond issuance, where money is withdrawn from circulation in exchange for a promise of repayment, converting present rights into future ones.">1</sup></p>

        <p>Now, this understanding of finance excludes many of the instruments and practices typically associated with the concept. For instance, it does not concern itself with equity-based instruments, where no party is legally obliged to pay the other; derivatives, whose pay-offs depend on market movements rather than on the eventual discharge of a debt; spot transactions, which involve the mutual exchange of assets; public deficits, which reflect a gap between revenues and expenditures rather than a contractual relation; or taxes, which are compulsory transfers of money. But just as cutting through dense underbrush reveals a new path through the landscape, so too does stripping finance of its conceptual ambiguity clear the way for a more focused understanding of what it is and what it does.</p>
        
        <p>In this more pared-down conception, finance appears as the superstructure of money. By this, I mean that the legal creditor–debtor relation constituive of finance can be used to bend and extend the economy-wide ledger so as to accomodate the transactional needs of people and businesses by offering them the ability to command resources in advance of having supplied any of their own. It does so in two principal ways: first, by reallocating existing money from one party to another, what I refer to as <em>lending</em>; and second, by enabling the creation of new money, what I refer to as <em>banking</em>. In both cases, finance introduces a degree of elasticity into the monetary system, influencing what can be transacted, when, and by whom. And this is, as Joseph Schumpeter rightly observed, a hallmark of modern capitalism: it is <em>“that form of private property economy in which innovations are carried out by means of borrowed money, which in general, though not by logical necessity, implies credit creation”</em> (<a href="https://www.mises.at/static/literatur/Buch/schumpeter-business-cycles-a-theoretical-historical-and-statistical-analysis-of-the-capitalist-process.pdf" target="_blank">1939</a>, p. 216).</p>

        <p>The following pages will proceed by examining these two dimensions—lending and banking—in turn, beginning with the former. Yet the analysis cannot end there. For the capacity of finance to reallocate or to create money is inseparable from the question of liquidity, that is, the ease with which funds can be accessed and deployed. Thus, the concept of liquidity presents itself as the natural continuation of the analysis, and it will accordingly form the third and final part of this inquiry into the nature of finance.</p>
