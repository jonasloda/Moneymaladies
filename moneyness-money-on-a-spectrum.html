        <h1 class="home-title">MONEYNESS</h1>
        <h1 class="about-title">MONEY ON A SPECTRUM</h1>

        <p>As a final step in this inquiry into the nature of money, I want to shift focus, turning from examining the ontology of money to considering the criteria by which we recognise something as money. Where, so the question becomes, do we draw the boundary between money and non-money? This question has acquired renewed saliency in recent years with the advent of Bitcoin, a phenomenon that seems to situate itself precisely on that boundary, neither comfortably within the traditional category of money nor entirely outside it. So, is Bitcoin money or something altogether different?</p>

        <p>Admittedly, the theory of money advanced here offers no help in determining what should or should not be called money. Assuming otherwise would be to misconstrue its purpose. It seeks to articulate the ontology of money rather than to catalogue the instruments that happen to fall within its scope.</p>

        <p>To engage meaningfully with the question, we therefore need to approach it differently. One possible approach, as the faithful functionalist would tell us, is to consider the functions Bitcoin performs, that is, to apply a kind of litmus test for whether it does the work of money. On this view, we need to ask whether Bitcoin functions as a means of exchange, a store of value, and a unit of account. When we evaluate Bitcoin according to these criteria, we find that Bitcoin can, and at times does, serve as a means of exchange, facilitating the circulation of goods and services. It also offers a unit of account and, at least in principle, a store of value. By functionalist standards, then, it performs the work of money and therefore is money.</p>
            
        <p>Yet, perhaps surprisingly, many functionalists remain hesitant to call Bitcoin money. At issue is the question of acceptability, that is, the question of how far an instrument must circulate or be accepted before it merits the name of money.</p>

        <p>The question of acceptability occupied a central place in the debates preceding the Bank Charter Act of 1844. While both the Currency and Banking schools agreed that money is defined primarily by its function as a general medium of exchange, they disagreed on what could legitimately be seen to fulfil that role, more specifically where the boundary of universal exchangeability should be drawn. The Currency school, articulated notably by George Warde Norman, maintained that money <i>“should be in universal demand by everybody, in all times and all places”</i> (quoted in <a href="https://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/townsend-a-history-of-banking-in-all-the-leading-nations-vol-2" target="_blank">Macleod, 1896</a>), meaning the money asset must retain demand both domestically and internationally, a requirement satisfied only by metallic currency. The Banking school, on the contrary, held that so long as an instrument enjoyed acceptability within the home market, it fulfilled the essential criterion of money, thus expanding the definition well beyond metallic currency (see <a href="https://archive.org/details/onregulationofcu00fulluoft" target="_blank">Fullarton, 1845</a>).</p>

        <p>Today, the demarcation between money and non-money continues to hinge upon the notion of acceptability: that which circulates broadly and settles a wide range of obligations is commonly admitted as money, and that which does not, is not. In effect, complementary currencies, like Bitcoin, are often relegated to the status of non-money. For instance, George Selgin (<a href="https://www.hillsdale.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/FMF-2014-Bitcoin-Problems-and-Prospects.pdf" target="_blank">2014</a>), the free-banking economist, argues that Bitcoin lacks general acceptability and therefore cannot meet the textbook definition of money. Others, however, claim that if an instrument functions as a medium of exchange within a particular domain, even if limited in scope, it may still rightly be regarded as money, thereby qualifying Bitcoin as such (<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3387886" target="_blank">Hazlett & Luther, 2019</a>). So again, where do we draw the boundary between money and non-money?</p>

        <p>It should be acknowledged that any attempt to fix such a boundary is inevitably arbitrary, for any line we draw would reflect less an objective property of money than our own conceptual and institutional biases. One approach, however, as Keynes suggested, would be to adopt a pragmatic stance by placing the boundary <i>“at whatever point is most convenient for handling a particular problem”</i> (<a href="https://archive.org/details/bmshri.generaltheoryofe0000john_f3y1" target="_blank">1936</a>, p. 167).</p>

        <p>But what if, instead of insisting on a boundary, we embrace the possibility that no such boundary needs to be drawn? I suggest that we understand money not as a binary thing (either money or not) but as something that exists along a continuum, possessing greater or lesser degrees of moneyness.</p>

        <p>Now, then, what do I mean by moneyness? Moneyness, as I here define it, is closely related to the idea of acceptance, but it should not be understood simply as the breadth of acceptance, that is, as the number of people, businesses, or institutions willing to accept a given medium in payment for goods, services or debt. After all, some things may be accepted by only a small community of people, yet be universally regarded as money, while others, though accepted by many, are seldom granted that status. Consider, for instance, the Seychellois rupee. Issued by a nation of roughly a hundred thousand people, it circulates entirely within Seychelles, yet is widely admitted as money. Bitcoin, by contrast, enjoys a far broader reach, as millions of people and businesses around the world are, at least in principle, willing to accept it, yet is commonly relegated to the status of non-money.</p>

        <p>When markets are fragmented, as in the case of Bitcoin, acceptance may be widespread in principle yet thin in practice. One might find countless people or businesses willing to transact in Bitcoin, but they are scattered across different jurisdictions, online platforms, and subcultures, often lacking the infrastructure that would make exchange frictionless. Its holders must constantly seek counterparties who will accept it, which, in turn, introduces transaction costs and uncertainty. The problem, then, is not the absence of acceptance per se, but the absence of a continuous market space in which economic rights can be reliably exercised.</p>

        <p>In this sense, we may say that moneyness is the degree to which some object forms a continuous space of exchange. Where moneyness is high, the economic rights inscribed in a given medium can be redeemed for a vast array of goods and services with minimal friction. Where moneyness is low, by contrast, those rights are recognised only within a narrow domain, valid, perhaps, for apples and bread, but not for rent, raw materials or wages. And even when it can be used for such payments, exchange remains costly and uncertain, since one must still spend time and resources locating willing counterparties.</p>

        <p>So, moneyness, as I define it here, is a property of money and, by extension, a function of markets. But if moneyness is a function of markets, we must be clear about what a market is. Here I want to draw on a strand of market microstructure theory, in particular the work of Jack Treynor (<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/4479073" target="_blank">1987</a>) and Colin Drumm (<a href="https://escholarship.org/uc/item/57h0m1x1" target="_blank">2021</a>), the former an American economist and pioneer of modern portfolio theory, and the latter an iconoclast of monetary history, both of whom understand markets not as spontaneous meeting places of buyers and sellers but as institutions sustained by the presence of market makers. These market makers, or dealers, are actors who continuously stand ready to buy or sell, and in doing so, make markets. Said, differently, they are the nodal points around which markets are organised, bringing together the otherwise scattered intentions of buyers and sellers into one continuous space of exchange. Absent such actors, exchange may occur, but there is no market in the strict sense, only scattered bilateral trades<sup class="footnote" data-footnote="Today, dealers who take positions on their own balance sheets and earn a spread by buying low and selling high coexist with platform-based intermediaries that resemble brokers more than dealers. Digital platforms of various kinds typically do not hold substantial inventories of the goods they help sell. Instead, they provide the technological and organisational infrastructure through which producers and consumers can find one another, contract, and settle payments. They do not, in the strict sense, assume inventory risk, but charge fees for access to, and participation in, the space of exchange they curate. In both cases, then, the market is mediated, and we pay, whether through a spread or a platform fee, for the very possibility of having a market in which we can reliably exercise our economic rights.">1</sup>.</p>

        <div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 80px; margin-bottom: 80px;">

        <p>Think of it like this: a market is not created by people occasionally wanting to trade, it is created by someone willing to always stand in the middle and make trade possible and frictionless. A grocery shop is a case in point. It purchases goods from wholesalers at one price and then sells them to customers at a higher price. By maintaining stock and posting stable prices, the grocery ensures that customers can obtain goods whenever they need them. At the same time, it provides producers with a dependable outlet through which they can offload their goods without having to search for end buyers themselves.</p>

        <p>So, a market comes into being when someone is willing to stand between upstream supply and downstream demand, buying at one price, selling at another, and earning a profit on the spread. That spread compensates the market maker for the risks it assumes, risks that are far from trivial. The merchant must hold inventory whose demand may decrease or whose quality may deteriorate. They tie up capital, commit to stock levels in advance, and expose themselves to uncertainties that buyers and sellers, arriving sporadically, do not bear. The spread is precisely the means through which they are paid for taking on these risks and for making a two-sided market.</p>

        </div>

        <p>To speak of moneyness, therefore, is to speak of the density and distribution of the market making infrastructure that surrounds the money asset. High moneyness corresponds to a situation in which many such market makers stand ready to intermediate exchange using a given medium, meaning there is not merely one merchant or dealer, but a whole ecology of them, like wholesalers, retailers, and a host of specialised intermediaries, each competing to quote prices. Competition among market makers compresses spreads and reduces the frictions associated with turning economic rights into the goods and services one desires.</p>

        <p>Low moneyness, by contrast, can be seen as the consequence of having no market makers to bind exchange into a unified market space. And this is precisely the problem Bitcoin faces. Even if many individuals are, in principle, willing to accept Bitcoin, the flow of Bitcoin-denominated transactions is too thin to sustain the market making business. Merchants cannot rely on a steady stream of customers willing to spend Bitcoin, nor can they replenish their stock in Bitcoin, as suppliers almost never accept it, meaning downstream demand is episodic and upstream acceptance effectively nonexistent. Without activity on both ends, no merchant can viably position themselves in the middle.</p>

        <p>Assuming, for the sake of argument, that there are sufficient end buyers willing to transact in Bitcoin, we might imagine a situation in which a merchant could still act as a market maker by acquiring inventory in fiat and selling it in Bitcoin. But even under such favourable assumption, the merchant faces substantial exchange-rate risk. Its costs are denominated in fiat, whereas its revenues would arrive in a medium whose value can fluctuate dramatically from hour to hour. Between receiving Bitcoin from a customer and converting it into fiat to pay suppliers, the merchant’s margin may be entirely consumed by price movements.</p>

        <p>Thus, the merchant must either bear the risk or hedge against it. But either option imposes a cost, and that cost must be recovered by widening the spread, that is, by charging a higher Bitcoin price to compensate. But a spread wide enough to offset Bitcoin’s volatility renders the price uncompetitive, discourages customers from paying in Bitcoin at all, and further reduces the inflow of buyers needed to support continuous market making. As a result, Bitcoin-denominated markets for ordinary goods fail to form.</p>

        <p>Still, it would be a mistake to conclude from this that Bitcoin lacks market makers altogether. On the contrary, market makers are plentiful in Bitcoin’s speculative realm, as trading firms continuously stand ready to buy or sell Bitcoin for fiat. They quote two-sided prices, hold inventory, and earn a spread, thereby creating deep and liquid markets where speculators can reliably enter or exit positions. But deep liquidity on exchanges reflects only that Bitcoin is easy to trade as an asset, not that it functions as a reliable medium of exchange within a social accounting system.</p>

        <p>To clarify further, liquidity and moneyness should be understood as conceptually separate. In short, liquidity is a property of trading, whereas moneyness is a property of exchange. By exchange I mean the transfer of one commodity for another. In a monetary economy, as we have seen, the act of exchange is decomposed into two sequential steps, selling one commodity for money, and buying another commodity with that money, expressed as C-M-C. Exchange therefore concerns the circulation of the social product. Trading, by contrast, inverts this logic, taking the form of M–C–M′, meaning that money is advanced to purchase commodities or assets not for their use, but with the explicit intention of reselling them for a profit. The trader does not seek goods but gains.</p>

        <p>Now, a market maker (who is, by definition, a type of trader) can facilitate either exchange or trading. When a market maker facilitates exchange, it enhances a medium’s moneyness by making it easier to redeem for real goods. When a market maker facilitates trading, by contrast, it enhances liquidity by making it easier to enter and exit speculative positions. And in the case of Bitcoin, market makers overwhelmingly support the latter, hence, I take Bitcoin’s moneyness to be low.</p>

        <p>Asking whether Bitcoin is money therefore becomes less a matter of taxonomy and more a matter of market making infrastructure. Bitcoin may possess some degree of moneyness, but that degree is still relatively low compared to fiat money, whose moneyness is reinforced by a dense, multi-layered network of market makers spanning virtually all segments of the economy. Rather than asking whether Bitcoin crosses some arbitrary threshold to become money, it is therefore more illuminating to ask how its moneyness might increase or decrease over time, depending on the emergence or disappearance of dealers willing to make a two-sided market in goods and services.</p>

        <p>What has come into view, then, is not a rule for deciding what is or is not money, but an understanding of the sense in which different media count as money to greater or lesser degrees. And with this perspective in place, the present section can be brought to a close. It remains now to draw together the conclusions and meditate on their implications, a task taken up in the postlude.</p>
