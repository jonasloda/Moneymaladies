        <h1 class="home-title">ON THE NATURE OF MONEY</h1>
        <h1 class="about-title">POSTLUDE</h1>

        <p>Milton Friedman wrote that <i>“one reason why money is a mystery to so many is the role of myth or fiction or convention”</i> (<a href="https://books.google.dk/books?id=lDF_uNIWQ_oC&printsec=frontcover&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false" target="_blank">1994</a>, p. 8). What he meant was that money derives its power not from any intrinsic property of the material object, but from the collective belief that others will accept the object in exchange. Money, said differently, comes into existence through a shared fiction, meaning we must all believe that each other will reliably part with goods and services for it. If we didn't, money would be stripped of its power in an instant. Indeed, no one would accept money because no one would trust that they could be exchanged for anything in return.</p>
        
        <p>Another way to say this is that money is a promise of payment in kind, that is, a sort of collective agreement that if you contribute something to the market today, you can draw out something of equal value tomorrow. We trust in this promise not because it is enforced by law, but because we believe and observe that others do the same. It is this shared faith, reinforced every time we make a transaction, that gives money power and makes the fiction real.</p>
        
        <p>In this sense, we might also say that money is credit. The word itself derives from the Latin <i>credere</i>, meaning <i>“to believe”</i> or <i>“to trust”</i>. So long as the collective belief remains intact, money endows its holder with a right to draw goods and services from the market, a right upheld by custom, not by statute. It is precisely this right that makes up the social face of money, what I call the money-relation.</p>

        <p>Still, mere belief cannot bring money into being. Absent a physical medium, exchange would rely on direct memory and the assumption that others speak truthfully about what they have given and received. What is needed, therefore, is a physical representation of this right in the form of a gold coin, a paper note, or an entry in a ledger, what I call the money-thing.</p>

        <p>In the same way that Christian theology holds Jesus to be the incarnation of an otherwise invisible God, I thus take the money-thing to be the incarnation of the intangible money-relation. The money-relation, in other words, ‘takes on flesh’ in the money-thing. Yet more than merely incarnating this relation, or economic right, the money-thing also translates it into units. In this capacity, the money-thing functions as a kind of abacus, or social accounting system, enabling society to document contributions to, and withdrawals from, the market, alongside allocating the economic rights such acts entail.</p>

        <p>My inquiry thus leads to the view that money is a Janus-faced phenomenon, comprising a social relation conferring a right to payment in kind, and simultaneously a material artifact that embodies and quantifies this right, transforming it into a kind of social accounting device.</p>
            
        <p>Now, if we accept this view of money, then the monetary economy cannot be understood merely as an exchange economy, but must also be seen as an accounting economy, one in which different accounting conventions prevail. As I have tried to show, these conventions differ in the principles by which new money are brought into existence. Broadly speaking, we can distinguish between conventions that issue money as recognition of past labor, as a promise of future labor, or by virtue of institutional authority.</p>

        <p>To be clear, characterising a monetary economy as an accounting economy does not imply that it is not also an exchange economy. In fact, a monetary economy is always and everywhere an exchange economy, since money is used to mediate exchange, allowing people to trade commodities with one another. Yet it is equally true that a monetary economy is always and everywhere an accounting economy. After all, each act of payment is like an entry in a social ledger that documents how much one has contributed to, or drawn from, the market. Without this ongoing process of record-keeping, exchange on the scale of a modern economy would be impossible.</p>

        <p>But while the monetary economy is necessarily both an exchange and an accounting economy, the reverse does not hold true. An exchange economy need not be monetary: people may trade directly without recourse to a medium of exchange, what we call barter. Nor must every accounting economy be monetary. As Schumpeter wrote (<a href="https://www.dl.fiqhci.com/library/Crypto/economy-money/En/Joseph-A.Schumpeter-Treatise-on-Money-WordBridge-Publishing%282014%29.pdf" target="_blank">2014</a>), we may conceive of the Socialist Commonwealth as a form of central bookkeeping, that is, a centrally administered ledger that records all production and consumption. In such a system, a central authority tallies contributions and determines how the social product is apportioned among participants, meaning there is no need for money.</p>

        <p>Accounting and exchange economies, therefore, may exist independently of money, but they may also exist independently of one another: Accounting without exchange, and exchange without accounting. In fact, it is only in the monetary economy that the two come together, since the act of exchange is here inseparable from the act of record-keeping. What distinguishes the monetary economy, therefore, is not merely that it facilitates exchange, but that it institutionalises accounting through exchange itself.</p>

        <div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 80px; margin-bottom: 80px;">
            <img src="Billeder/venn.png" alt="A Credit View of Money" width="500px">
        </div>

        <p>Thus, we can think of the monetary economy as a marriage of two principles: accounting and exchange. If we were to remove either, the economy would collapse into barter on the one hand, or a Socialist Commonwealth on the other. In this sense, both are equally vital to its functioning.</p>

        <p>Still, the accounting side merits analytical precedence. The reason is simply that exchange is bound to a system of bookkeeping, and it is the rules of this bookkeeping system that set the conditions of exchange: accounting conventions–along with the entities in charge of the money-ledger–influence who gets to spend, in what amounts, on what uses, and at what costs, which, by extension, helps determine what is produced, in what volume, and how it is distributed.</p>

        <p>Accounting, then, governs the terms of exchange, whereas exchange does not, and cannot, in turn, govern the principles by which accounting is done. Any serious inquiry into the monetary economy must therefore begin not with considering the principles of exchange, but with the architecture of the accounting system that underwrites it.</p>

        <p>Additonally, it must be acknowledged that economic rights recorded in a ledger acquire practical value only insofar as there exists a social arena in which they can be exercised. It follows that neither accounting nor exchange occurs in a vacuum. Both take place within a socially organised space, limited in time and place, in which buyers and sellers meet, what we call the market. Money, therefore, must be understood in relation to the market, since it is only within the market that the right embodied in the money-thing can be exercised. Consequently, if we are to understand money, we must also understand markets.</p>

        <p>One might be tempted to think of the market as a multitude of bilateral trades between buyers and sellers who happen to find one another, or, in a more canonical vein, as a centralised auction system that orchestrates these encounters from above. But, as the earlier discussion of market makers suggests, this picture is misleading. In any modern sense of the word, markets are brought into being and held together by actors who specialise in organising exchange. These actors (retailers and wholesalers whom we collectively refer to as market makers) stand between upstream suppliers and downstream consumers, continuously quoting prices, bearing risks, and thereby creating two-sided markets for commodities.</p>

        <p>In this respect, market makers are not accidental embellishments to an otherwise self-sufficient market, but are constitutive of it. By agreeing to buy and sell, they weave together the fragmented intentions of individual buyers and sellers into a coherent space in which economic rights can be reliably exercised. The accounting system that endows agents with economic rights would be of little practical value were it not complemented by this market-making infrastructure that allows exchange to happen with minimal friction. The institution of money, therefore, encompasses not only the ledger that records rights, but also the institutional machinery through which those rights can be realised.</p>

        <p>Instead of beginning with a taxonomy that sorts objects into <i>money</i> and <i>non-money</i>, it is therefore more fruitful to think in terms of a continuum of <i>moneyness</i>. On this view, what matters is not whether an asset is, in some absolute sense, money, but the degree to which the rights it embodies can be converted, on demand and at predictable terms, into commodities. That degree of moneyness is, in turn, a function of the market-making infrastructure that surrounds the asset in question, meaning the density and depth of the markets in which it trades and the presence (or absence) of committed dealers.</p>

        <p>Taking this line of reasoning one step further (and briefly beyond our immediate scope), if money can only be understood in relation to markets, then so too must the value of money. The money–market relation is not exhausted by the qualitative question of moneyness, but also has a quantitative dimension, expressed in prices, which indicate how much of a given good can be obtained for a unit of money at a particular time and place.</p>

        <p>Seen in this light, commodity prices cannot be understood as a mechanical function of the quantity of money in circulation, as is often assumed in both popular and academic discourse. Such quantity-based accounts abstract from the concrete market settings in which economic rights are exercised. While changes in the money supply may condition the overall level of nominal demand, they do not, by themselves, determine the prices at which goods exchange.</p>

        <p>Prices are formed within markets through the interaction of buyers, sellers, and market makers. Buyers express demand through their willingness and ability to spend; sellers bring goods to market under conditions shaped by costs, productive capacities, and competitive pressures; and market makers organise exchange as they buy cheap and sell dear, with the spread being set by volume, inventory risks, operating costs, and competition. Prices emerge from this interplay, not from any single element in isolation. Accordingly, the same quantity of money may translate into very different price levels depending on how markets are organised. Competitive conditions, production technologies, labour costs, effective demand, and market-making infrastructure determine how economic rights are translated into prices, and with this, the value of money.</p>
            
        <p>It would be tempting to press this argument further and draw out its implications for monetary theory and policy. To do so now, however, would be to run ahead of ourselves. Before we get there, more conceptual groundwork must be laid. The next step is therefore to turn to finance, understood not as a mere extension of money, but as its conceptual counterpart.</p>
