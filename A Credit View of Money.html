        <h1 class="about-title">A CREDIT VIEW</h1>

        <p>
            From our vantage point here on Earth, planets and stars appear to move around us. For more than a thousand years, Europeans took this appearance for fact, believing that Earth stood fixed at the center of the cosmos, a view reinforced by religious doctrine and Ptolemy’s geocentric model. It was, for its time, a complete and convincing picture of the world, one that seemed to reconcile experience, reason, and faith. That sense of certainty began to unravel in 1543. That year, Nicolaus Copernicus, a Renaissance polymath, published a book in which he advanced the radical idea that the motion we see in the heavens is, in fact, our own, meaning it is not the Sun that moves around us, but we who move around the Sun. </p>
            
            <p>It is maybe not surprising that Copernicus’s model was met with skepticism and failed, at first, to displace the prevailing cosmology. But over the following centuries it gradually gained acceptance, due in part to Galileo’s telescopic observations and Kepler’s mathematical refinements. Yet, it was not before 1838, nearly three centuries after Copernicus' work, that Friedrich Bessel provided observational proof of Earth's rotation around the Sun. By detecting the slight displacement in a star’s position as seen from different points along Earth’s orbit—a phenomenon known as stellar parallax—Bessel confirmed a long-held prediction of heliocentrism, and in doing so, solidified its place within the realm of scientific truth. Thus, a figurative shift in perspective was substantiated by a literal one.
        </p>

        <p>
            I begin with this oft-told story of the heliocentric turn not because it has anything to teach us about money, but because it offers a valuable lesson in how progress in knowledge so often depends on a shift in perspective. Taking this lesson to heart, I will examine money as a parallax object, one that must be perceived through different perspectives if we are to illuminate its social foundations in new and important ways.
        </p> 
            <p>Before doing so, however, it is worth clarifying what I mean by parallax, especially as the idea may be unfamiliar to some readers. In astronomy, the parallax effect refers to the apparent shift in the position of an object when it is observed from different perspectives. For example, when you look at a nearby star from the same position on Earth six months apart, the star seems to move slightly against the background of more distant stars, not because the star itself has moved, but because our position has changed. Appearance, said differently, is conditioned by perspective. And that, in essence, is what parallax is all about.</p>
                
        <p>Now, while traditionally associated with the shifting appearance of celestial bodies in the night sky, parallax also manifests in the hierarchy of money, that is, the layered nature of money within capitalist economies (see <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/23599602" target="_blank">Kelton 2001</a> & <a href="https://sites.bu.edu/perry/files/2019/04/Mehrling_P_FESeminar_Sp12-02.pdf" target="_blank">Mehrling 2012</a>). Here, one entity uses the liabilities of another entity as money, meaning that money is perceived differently depending on the observer’s standpoint: What appears as money from one perspective is seen as credit from another, that is, a <em>means of payment</em> and a <em>promise of payment</em>, respectively (<a href="https://sites.bu.edu/perry/files/2019/04/Mehrling_P_FESeminar_Sp12-02.pdf" target="_blank">ibid.</a>).

        <p>
            Consider the classical gold standard as an illustration of the parallax effect. Upended at the onset of the First World War in 1914, it positioned gold as international money used to settle final trade balances between nation states. In this capacity, gold occupied the apex of the hierarchy of money, providing the base asset against which a pyramiding superstructure of credit instruments were issued.
       Thus, while nation states used gold as money to settle trade balances between them, central banks issued currency backed by this very gold<sup class="footnote" data-footnote="Henry Dunning Macleod (1866), and later Ralph George (Hawtrey), define currency as that which circulates from hand to hand, thus being 'current'. This definition includes notes and coins, while excluding demand and reserve deposits, which are book-entries in the ledgers of banks and central banks, respectively. However, I here use currency to refer to central bank liabilities in the form of coins, notes, and reserve deposits.">1</sup>. To those who held it, currency appeared as money, that is, a reliable means of payment used to purchase goods and settle debts, but from the central bank's perspective it was merely a promise to exchange each note for gold upon the holder’s demand, rendering it a promise to pay.
        </p>
        <p>
            While gold and currency formed the basis of the monetary system, they were not the only forms of money in circulation at the time. Alongside them, bank deposits circulated widely. These deposits were issued by commercial banks and backed by central bank currency. For deposit holders, whether individuals or businesses, they represented money. But for the banks, they were liabilities, or promises to pay, constituting a formal commitment to deliver currency on demand. Depending on one's position, deposits, like currency, were thus perceived differently, being at once both money and credit.

        </div>

        <p>
            Although the classical gold standard was eventually consigned to history, a similar logic has continued to inform later systems. Under Bretton Woods, U.S. currency was formally backed by gold, while U.S. bank deposits were issued against that currency. What resulted was a tiered system with gold at the apex, currency issued against it, and dollar-denominated deposits issued against currency. Today’s fiat currencies are similarly double-faced, with bank deposits issued as promises to pay currency on demand. But unlike Bretton Woods, where US currency was redeemable for gold, modern fiat systems lack any such anchor. Instead, currency now sits at the apex of the system.
        
        </p>

        <p>
        Across modern monetary systems, then, money is organised as a hierarchy of credit instruments issued against higher-quality money assets. What counts as <em>money</em> from one position counts as <em>credit</em> from another, and each layer draws its legitimacy from the layer above. But what is to be said about the apex of the pyramid?
        </p>

        <p>
            To answer this question, it is worth reconsidering the role of gold under the classical gold standard. Gold, as noted, was the highest form of money, and in this respect, it appeared to sit above the credit hierarchy altogether because, unlike deposits and currency, it was an asset without any offsetting liability. But Henry Dunning Macleod (<a href="https://books.google.dk/books/about/The_Theory_of_Credit.html?id=TeUoAAAAYAAJ&redir_esc=y" target="_blank">1893</a>), a 19th-century Scottish banker and maverick economist<sup class="footnote" data-footnote="John R. Commons regarded Henry Dunning Macleod as the originator of institutional economics. While Macleod’s influence was largely neglected by mainstream economists, Commons credited him as the first thinker to shift the focus of economics from the exchange of physical things to the exchange of rights. For Macleod, exchange-value did not reside in material objects themselves, but in their transferable ownership, understood legally as rights and duties. Economics, in his formulation, became the study of the alienation and acquisition of property rights. Commons saw in this legal and institutional framing a radical break from classical and neoclassical traditions, and thus recognised Macleod as the first to articulate the core of what would become institutional economics (See Commons, 1959).">2</sup>, opposed this view, arguing that gold was itself a form of credit<sup class="footnote" data-footnote="Macleod was hardly a lone voice in advancing such claims. Long before him, and well after, thinkers devoted to the so-called credit theory of money have forwarded similar ideas. Among them stand William Potter, George Berkeley, Frédéric Bastiat, John Ruskin, Friedrich Bendixen, Knut Wicksell, Ernest Solvay, George Simmel, Frederick Soddy, Ralph George Hawtrey, Joseph Schumpeter, and Geoffrey Ingham.">3</sup>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Admittedly, this is a peculiar claim. To get a better understanding of what he meant, let us take a step back and begin with a simple example. Consider a blacksmith and a farmer striking a simple bargain: The blacksmith crafts a plow today and gives it to the farmer, who, in return, promises the blacksmith a share of the upcoming harvest. To formalise this promise, the farmer issues an IOU, that is, a note acknowledging his obligation to deliver a portion of the future yield. In doing so, the blacksmith becomes a creditor, holding a claim on the farmer’s future output, while the farmer assumes the role of a debtor, bound to repay his debt when the fields bear fruit. The balance between the parties is restored only when the blacksmith redeems the IOU, receiving his share of the harvest, at which point both parties have fulfilled their obligations. The exchange, long in the making, comes to its natural conclusion, leaving both their needs satisfied.
        </p>

        <p>
            What insight does this allegory offer? To Macleod, monetary exchange is a scaled-up version of this bargain, with money perfoming the function of a transferrable IOU: money <em>“is nothing more than the evidence of services having been rendered for which an equivalent has not been received, but can at any time be demanded”</em> (<a href="https://books.google.dk/books/about/The_Theory_and_Practice_of_Banking.html?id=jLRLAAAAYAAJ&redir_esc=y" target="_blank">Macleod 1866</a>, p. 16). In the eyes of Macleod, then, money is a right to draw from the market's reservoir of commodities, or, as it were, a claim on goods and services, much like a bank deposit is a claim on currency<sup class="footnote" data-footnote="This very logic led Daniel Webster, an American statesman, to conclude that “credit is to money what money is to goods” (quoted in Macleod 1893, p. 92).">4</sup>. In this sense, the world becomes, metaphorically, the debtor of the money-holder, who <em>“can collect his debt from the rest of the world by purchasing other products or services.”</em> (<a href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.49015000887415&seq=434&q1=The+rest+of+the+world+is+therefore+also+his+%22debtor" target="_blank">Commons, 1959, p. 416</a>)<sup class="footnote" data-footnote="It should meanwhile be noted that Commons rejected Macleod's idea of money as credit.">5</sup>. Perceived as such, the apical asset appears as a promise of the market to deliver goods and services in the future, implying that gold may be understood as both money and credit.
        </p>

        <p>
            But while persuasive, this credit-theoretical framing introduces a definitional problem. If we follow Alfred Mitchell Innes—a British diplomat and monetary theorist—in defining <em>debt</em> and <em>credit</em> as terms signifying <em>“a legal relationship between two parties”</em> (<a href="https://cooperative-individualism.org/innes-a-mitchell_what-is-money-1913-may.pdf" target="_blank">1913</a>, p. 17), it becomes clear that gold cannot be considered a form of credit, since it entails no obligation to compensate its bearer. In other words, gold is an asset that lacks a legally defined counterparty. The notion that the gold-holder is a creditor and, conversely, that the world is a debtor, appears therefore untenable: there exists no legal or moral obligation for the world to compensate the bearer of gold.
        </p>

        <p>
            Again, this presents a problem, but only if we insist on understanding credit as a contractual relationship enforceable by law, and not as a economic relation rooted in custom. This is precisely the interpretive shift urged by John Ruskin (<a href="https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/media/lancaster-university/content-assets/documents/ruskin/17Untothislast.pdf" target="_blank">1905, p. 197</a>) and Knut Wicksell (<a href="https://cdn.mises.org/Lectures%20on%20Political%20Economy%20-%20Volume%20II%20Money_2.pdf" target="_blank">1935, p. 23</a>), the former a Victorian social critic and the latter a Swedish economist. Both argued that gold, in its capacity as money, should be understood not through the lens of legal formality but through that of economic practice. They believed that money functions as credit <em>de facto</em>, not <em>de jure</em>, meaning the bearer of gold does not hold a legally enforceable claim against the market but rather possesses an economic right to a share of its output, validated by the continued willingness of others to accept it in exchange. Gold thus represents a standing expectation that others will reliably part with goods and services for it, and in this sense it embodies a tacit promise that payment will, in time, return in kind. In other words, gold is credit<sup class="footnote" data-footnote="Macleod's theory must be distinguished from that of Innes. While Innes argued that all money is credit de jure—constituting legal obligations between defined parties—Macleod maintained that money functions as credit de facto, embodying economic rights to the output of the market rather than legally enforceable debts. Though the two theorists are often grouped together under the credit theory of money, as Keynes did in his review of “What is Money?” (1914), they represent distinct instantiations of the credit theory that should not be conflated.">6</sup>.
        </p>

        <p>
            To help solidify our understanding of this non-legal credit relationship, it is helpful to dissect the act of exchange into its constituent parts. The French physiocrat Guillaume-François Le Trosne, along with many of his contemporaries, defined exchange as the act of swapping one good or service for another (see <a href="https://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/townsend-a-history-of-banking-in-all-the-leading-nations-vol-2" target="_blank">Macleod 1896</a>), a process epitomised in <em>quid-pro-quo</em> barter. In a monetary economy, however, exchange comprises a two-step process involving a sale, where a commodity is traded for money, and a purchase, where that money is subsequently traded for a commodity, a process illustrated by Karl Marx in the formula <em>Commodity-Money-Commodity</em>, or <em>C—M—C</em>. Only when the individual who has parted with a commodity receives an equivalent in return can the exchange be said to be consummated. Frédéric Bastiat (<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/45002/45002-h/45002-h.htm" target="_blank">2014</a>), a 19th-century French liberalist, put it plainly when stating that <em>“exchange is not complete until the man who has made an effort for another man receives in return an equivalent service”</em>. If, therefore, a sale is not accompanied by a subsequent purchase, the act of exchange is left unresolved, what can be thought of as a <em>demi-exchange</em> (<a href="https://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/townsend-a-history-of-banking-in-all-the-leading-nations-vol-2" target="_blank">Macleod 1896</a>) or <em>half a transaction</em> (<a href="https://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/walker-political-economy" target="_blank">Walker 1892</a>).
        </p>

        <p>
            To the extent that the exchange relation consists of converting one commodity for another, we see money as the indispensable intermediary, popularly termed <em>the medium of exchange</em>. Herein lies the credit-like nature of money. For someone to part with a commodity, there must be a guarantee—explicit or implicit—that a commodity of equivalent value will be obtained in return. Money, as the medium of exchange, embodies this assurance. Again, Bastiat put it best:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            <p><em>“if you can read with the eyes of the mind the inscription [money] bears, you can see distinctly these words: ‘Pay to the bearer a service equivalent to that which he has rendered to society, value received and stated, proved and measured by that which is on me”</em> (Quoted in <a href="https://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/townsend-a-history-of-banking-in-all-the-leading-nations-vol-2" target="_blank">Macleod 1896</a>)</p> 
        </blockquote>

        <p>
            By parting with a commodity, the seller receives what appears to be a promise of payment, that is, a right to be compensated in kind. The buyer, on the contrary, surrenders what appears to be a means of payment, that is, they excersise a right to be compensated in kind. Thus, the money asset, like the stars in the night sky, presents itself differently depending on the standpoint from which it is observed. What the buyer sees as a means of payment, the seller perceives as a promise of payment. These two views, though distinct, are inseparable facets of the same coin: Money functions as a means of payment precisely because it embodies a promise of payment. Or said differently, if money did not encompass a promise to be compensated in kind, would one ever willingly accept it?
        </p>

        <p>
            Returning to the question of gold, it now becomes apparent that its status as a form of credit derives not from any legal designation, but in its perceived ability to command goods, services, and assets within a market: it is a pledge for <em>“future performance of counter-services to which [the bearer] is economically entitled by virtue of the services he has performed”</em> (<a href="https://cdn.mises.org/Lectures%20on%20Political%20Economy%20-%20Volume%20II%20Money_2.pdf" target="_blank">Wicksell, 1935, p. 23</a>). The value of these counter-services is crucially subject to the price-forming dynamics of a market economy, much like the value of a derivative is determined by the price of its underlying asset. The gold-bearer, therefore, is not guaranteed to receive a fixed quantity or type of goods. Instead, what can be claimed is subject to varying market conditions, including production capacities, wages, politics, competition, consumer demand, and much more.
            It is, in the words of John R. Commons (<a href="https://historyofeconomicthought.mcmaster.ca/commons/LegalFoundationsCapitalism.pdf" target="_blank">1924, p. 258</a>), the <em>“power to obtain in exchange, not a specific thing, but power to obtain anything at the then price of anything”</em>. In this capacity—and revising Georg Simmel's oft-cited metaphor of money as <em>“a bill of exchange from which the name of the drawee is lacking”</em> (<a href="https://www.eddiejackson.net/web_documents/Philosophy%20of%20Money.pdf" target="_blank">2004, p. 258</a>)—one may think of gold as a call option on the market's stock of commodities from which the name of the option writer, the strike price, and the expiration date are lacking.
        </p>

        <p>
            Notably, the impersonal credit relation sketched here pervades all money assets, including currency and deposits. Like gold, they embody a non-formal claim on the market for services to which the money-holder is economically entitled. Therefore, while only some types of money qualify as credit in a strictly legal sense, all money necessarily acts as credit in a purely practical one. And this, I contend, is the essence of the money-relation: <em>it is a readily redeemable and non-legal right to receive goods, services, and assets from the market</em>. This right may be granted as a reward for services already rendered, or it may stem from a pledge to deliver goods or services in the future, as is the case with money obtained through loans. Here, the borrower acquires an economic right to receive goods or services before having contributed any to the market, in effect counterbalancing this right with a corresponding obligation, a subject examined more fully in the chapter on finance. The money-relation, in its full form, can therefore be summarised as <em>a readily redeemable and non-legal right to receive goods, services, and assets from the market granted by virtue of past or future contributions</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Now, let me pause to reaffirm a key distinction: this right is economic, not legal, in nature. This formal distinction, however, should not blind us to the fundamental similarities between economic and legal rights. As John R. Commons (<a href="https://historyofeconomicthought.mcmaster.ca/commons/LegalFoundationsCapitalism.pdf" target="_blank">1924, p. 109</a>) noted in his discussion of legal rights, such rights do not exist as an <em>“eternal, heavenly, natural, or preexisting 'substance,' apart from the actual behavior of [those] who are depended upon to recognize and enforce it”.</em> What Commons said of legal rights holds equally true for economic ones: They both rely on some actors, whether market participants or legal authorities, to recognise and enforce them. In both cases, the right exists only in the minds of individuals as a prediction or assumption that past rules will continue to apply in the future: it is but <em>“a mental process, a hope, a fear, an expectation that since a certain working rule has been applied in the past, it will be applied again in similar cases”</em> (<a href="https://historyofeconomicthought.mcmaster.ca/commons/LegalFoundationsCapitalism.pdf" target="_blank">ibid.</a>). Legal rights are therefore no more self-sustaining than economic ones, and vice versa. Both rest on the continuity of the systems—economic or legal—that uphold them. If the market continues to function as it has in the past, we can therefore expect to exercise these rights in the future, but should those underlying conditions erode, so too will the rights themselves.
        </p>

        <p>
            The money-relation, then, presents itself as an economic right to future payment in kind sustained by market conventions rather than by legal decree. But for this right to be exercised, it must take form. It must be recorded and quantified. Just as law finds its expression in written statutes and rulings, the money-relation finds its expression in the money-thing, through which it assumes a presence in the world. And it is this transformation—from relation to representation—that now demands our attention.
