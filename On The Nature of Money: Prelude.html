        <h1 class="home-title">ON THE NATURE OF MONEY</h1>
        <h1 class="about-title">PRELUDE</h1>

        <p><span class="dropcap">D</span>uring a parliamentary debate on the Bank Charter Act of 1844, the British statesman Sir William Gladstone reportedly quipped that <em>“even love has not turned more men into fools than has meditation upon the nature of money”</em> (quoted in <a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1859/critique-pol-economy/ch02_1.htm#mov" target="_blank">Marx 1859</a>). And money, indeed, despite being an institution of our own making, has proved stubbornly hard to define, at least in any way that commands general agreement. So much so that <em>“you scarcely find two individuals who, whatever may be their concurrence in other respects, are exactly agreed as to what constitutes money and what does not”</em>, as the Banking School partisan John Fullarton (<a href="https://books.google.dk/books?id=VFrWcPfECngC&printsec=frontcover&hl=da&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false" target="_blank">1844</a>) put it. Across the history of economic thought, questions about what qualifies as money have thus elicited a wide range of conflicting answers, often reflecting disagreements over its material form<sup class="footnote" data-footnote="Metallists tied money to a particular substance. William Huskisson, an intellectual forebear of the Currency School, declared that “it was the essence of money to possess intrinsic value” (quoted in Duncan, 1856), meaning it must consist of precious metals. Marx, too, wrote that “gold and silver are not by nature money, but money by nature gold and silver” (Capital, vol. 1, ch. 2). By contrast, chartalist and credit theorists denied that material substance was essential. Friedrich Knapp, for instance, opened The State Theory of Money with the claim that “money is a creature of law,” adding that “the soul of currency is not in the material of the pieces, but in the legal ordinances which regulate their use.” (1924, pp. 1, 2).">1</sup>, its attributes<sup class="footnote" data-footnote="For the Currency School, paper notes were deemed money only insofar as they were convertible on demand into coin. Convertability, then, was seen as one of the defining attributes of paper money. In a similar vein, the renowned cartographer of global finance, Zoltan Pozsar, today argues that the quintessential attribute of money is its ability to “trade at par on demand,” that is, to be instantly convertible into other forms of money without loss. In effect, the category of money is broadened beyond its conventional bounds, drawing within it not only demand deposits, but also repurchase agreements and Net Asset Value shares of Money Market Funds.">2</sup>, and the boundaries of its acceptance<sup class="footnote" data-footnote="When US Congress issued greenbacks during the Civil War and endowed them with legal-tender status, they were swiftly taken up as transaction media and widely accepted across the country. To many, this was enough to warrant calling them money, a view affirmed in the Legal Tender Acts, which stated that “United States notes shall be lawful money and a legal tender in payment of all debts, public and private, within the United States” (quoted in Legal Tender Cases, 1884). Others, however, demurred. Daniel Webster, an American statesman, insisted that money must be able “not only to pass in payments and receipts among individuals of the same society and nation, but to adjust and discharge the balance of exchanges between different nations” (Ibid.). Webster thus treated world‑wide exchangeability as the sine qua non of money. Notably, a similar disagreement had unfolded in England decades earlier between the Currency and Banking Schools.">3</sup>. 
        </p> 

        <p>Yet, despite this long-running discord, modern economists have largely settled on a definition. Thus, most contemporary economists subscribe to a functionalist understanding of money, defining money in terms of its functions. This view, repeated in creedal fashion across textbooks and lecture halls, has crystallised into a well-known aphorism that <em>money is what money does</em>. And what it does, we are told, is threefold: it serves as a medium of exchange, a store of value, and a unit of account. These functions assign to money the task of facilitating and mediating trade, preserving purchasing power over time, and providing a numerical metric, or standardised yardstick, for measuring debt and the relative value of goods and services.</p>

        <p>But though firmly enshrined in the canon of economic orthodoxy, the functionalist account of money has not gone unchallenged. A number of criticisms have been leveled against it, calling into question its validity. Among these is the charge of circularity: that any attempt to define money by its functions presupposes the very identity it sets out to explain. That is to say, if we do not yet know what money is, how can we meaningfully specify what it does? (<a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/monetary-policy-9780199248568?cc=dk&lang=en&" target="_blank">Bofinger 2001</a>).</p>

        <p> From the perspective of the faithful functionalist such criticisms may seem misplaced. The aim is not to uncover what money is in some ontological sense, but to provide a set of criteria by which money can be easily identified wherever it appears: <em>"Economists identify money through the roles that it serves in society"</em>, as stated in the Bank of England’s Quarterly Bulletin (<a href="https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/-/media/boe/files/quarterly-bulletin/2014/innovations-in-payment-technologies-and-the-emergence-of-digital-currencies.pdf" target="_blank">2014</a>). Functionalists, then, treat money, like any other tool, as something defined by its practical use rather than by some metaphysical substance. The British economist Ralph George Hawtrey, writing a century ago, expressed the same idea, stating that <em>“[m]oney is one of those concepts which, like a teaspoon or an umbrella, but unlike an earthquake or a buttercup, are definable primarily by the use or purpose which they serve”</em> (<a href="https://archive.org/details/currencycredit00hawtrich/page/n5/mode/2up" target="_blank">1919, p. 1</a>). Just as a teaspoon is what we use to stir our tea, money, too, is what we use to exchange goods, measure value, and store purchasing power. Thus, for the functionalist the meaning of money arises from a set of functions, not from any ontological essence that precedes those functions. 
        </p>

        <p>Still, while it may be true that a teaspoon is defined by its use, not everything used to stir tea becomes a teaspoon. A twig may perform the same task, but it does not acquire the name or the status. Clearly, then, there is more to being a teaspoon than simply stirring tea, such as its form and material. In fact, we identify something as a teaspoon before we put it to work. This, of course, is not entirely true for money. Even if we recognise money in advance of using it, money, unlike the teaspoon, does not assume any fixed form. It may present itself as cowrie shells, paper, or entries in a ledger. The form of money can be arbitrary—within limits—precisely because money is not a tool crafted to manipulate the material world, but an instrument used to mediate and coordinate human relations. This is exactly why Robinson Crusoe, upon becoming stranded, finds that money is <em>“of no manner of value”</em> (<a href="https://www.planetpublish.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Robinson_Crusoe_BT.pdf" target="_blank">Defoe 1719</a>). Money, as
            is patently obvious, derives its value from the social relations it mediates, expressed and organised
            through the market, <em>“in the absence of which the holders of the money asset will learn, like Midas, that
            they cannot eat it”</em> (<a href="https://escholarship.org/uc/item/57h0m1x1" target="_blank">Drumm 2021</a>).
            
            <p>Money, we can reasonably conclude, then, is a social instrument. Yet, functionalists have largely bracketed out the social dimension of money, not by explicitly rejecting it, but by routinely treating it as analytically irrelevant. By reducing the concept of money to some object performing a set of specified functions, they appear to treat money as little more than a thing. Put differently, money is understood not as a set of social relations but as any item—whatever its material form—that serves as a medium of exchange, a store of value, and a unit of account: <em>“Always and everywhere that which does the money-work is the money-thing”</em>, in the words of Francis Walker (<a href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433023166568&seq=7" target="_blank">1880</a>, p. 1).</p>

        <p>The functionalist tendency to reify money has, perhaps expectedly, drawn fire.
            Echoing Karl Marx (<a href="https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/download/pdf/Poverty-Philosophy.pdf" target="_blank">1847</a>), and often with missionary fervor, a chorus of dissenting voices proclaim that <em>“money is not a thing, it is a social relation”</em>. But in their effort to challenge the functionalist view, the critics have swung too far in the opposite direction, offering a definition that neglects the material realities upon which these social relations depend. Accordingly, they ignore the fact that money
            always exists as something with a material presence, whether in physical or digital form. Money, it is obvious, cannot be
            anything but a thing, as the social relations it mediates rely on their ability to be quantified and preserved. 
            The materiality of money, therefore, is essential, grounding
            abstract social relations in something tangible and quantifiable.</p>

        <p>It seems reasonable, then, to conclude that both functionalists and their critics are, in their own ways, partly right and partly wrong.  What is needed therefore, so my conviction goes, is a synthesis that brings these perspectives together into a more coherent and comprehensive framework, one that recognises that money works upon two planes: the material and the social. Yet it is also one that sees that the social plane is analytically distinct from the material one, meaning the social value of money—what I shall call the <em>money-relation</em>—must be distinguished from the physical or virtual objects that embody and represent it, termed here as the <em>money-thing</em>.
            Indeed, it is these two concepts, intertwined like the faces of a coin, that will guide my inquiry as I seek to define: <em>What is money?</em><sup class="footnote" data-footnote="My examination of money will bypass the question of acceptability—that is, the question of why and how money becomes adopted within a social setting. In doing so, it sets aside the ontogeny of money in favor of its ontology: what money is, rather than how it comes to be. Moving beyond the dichotomy between the chartalist view of money as a state-driven, top-down phenomenon and the barter-theoretical depiction of money as a spontaneously emerging market phenomenon, it is here assumed that money come into existence by both coercive and organic means.">4</sup>

        <p>The answer to this question unfolds through two complementary views, each offering a distinct lens through
            which to see money: The first—<a href="A Credit View of Money.html"><em>a credit view</em></a>—interprets the money-relation as a present right to a future payment in kind. The second—<a href="An Accounting View of Money.html"><em>an accounting view</em></a>—treats the money-thing as the tangible or virtual medium through which such rights are measured, recorded, and excersised.</p>

        <p>Yet, defining money is only half the job. The other half is determining what counts as money. In the third section of this chapter, I take up this task, proposing that money is not a binary concept (either money or not) but something that exists along a spectrum of <a href="Moneyness: Money on a Spectrum.html"><em>moneyness</em></a>.</p>

        <p>The remainder of this chapter is dedicated to developing and integrating these ideas in full. In pursuing this, my hope is (quite ambitiously, I admit) to establish the groundwork for a new and comprehensive theory of money, one that is able to account for the full, complex range of monetary phenomena in past, present, and future economies.</p>
