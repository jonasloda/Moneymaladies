        <h1 class="about-title">AN ACCOUNTING VIEW</h1>

        <p>
            The money-relation, in its defined form, is an impersonal credit relationship wherein the money holder has a right to draw
                from the market's pool of goods. As such, the money-relation <em>“is not wealth, but a documentary claim to wealth”</em> (<a href="https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/media/lancaster-university/content-assets/documents/ruskin/17Untothislast.pdf" target="_blank">Ruskin 1905, p. 157-158</a>), with <em>“every such claim implying precisely as much poverty or debt on one side, as it implies riches or right on the other” </em>(<a href="https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/media/lancaster-university/content-assets/documents/ruskin/17Untothislast.pdf" target="_blank">ibid., p. 45</a>). 
                
                <p>This relation, however, remains purely abstract until it is given a material form. That form, much like the body to the spirit, is the money-thing, examples of which include coins, notes, and numbers in a ledger. Without it, the money-relation would require conditions humanly untenable, above all perfect memory and perfect trust. Perfect memory because every transaction would have to be recalled indefinitely, like who gave what, who took what, and the rights and obligations that resulted. And perfect trust since each participant would have to rely wholly on others’ honesty, accepting without hesitation whatever they claimed about past exchanges. In other words, a purely immaterial money-relation presupposes a society in which no one forgets and no one misstates or disputes any claim about what they have given and received.</p>
                    
                <p>What is more, the money-relation by itself cannot be used to determine the relative value of commodities, since it establishes only a right to future payment in kind, not a scale by which heterogeneous commodities—and the rights arising from their exchange—can be compared. What is at issue, then, is how the market registers what has been brought before it: how one commodity is weighed against the rest, and how its value appears both to others and to the person who offered it. A computer and a candle, for example, are both commodities, yet in the absence of a shared standard of valuation there is no way to establish how many candles would be equivalent in value to a single computer.</p>

                <p>Only by taking on a material form, then, can the money-relation overcome the practical deficiencies that attend it in the abstract. The money-thing keeps track of who has given what and what they are entitled to in return, so exchange no longer depends on participants remembering past transactions and trusting others’ accounts of them. At the same time, it provides a common unit in which different contributions can be expressed and compared. Taken together, the money-thing serves as a social record of actors’ contributions to production and their share in the consumption of its outcomes, while tracking the economic rights that follow. The credit view of money thus extends into an accounting view.</p>
            
            <p>The accounting view of money, detailed in Joseph Schumpeter’s <em>Treatise on Money</em> and regarded as the <em>“basic concept of monetary doctrine”</em> (<a href="https://www.dl.fiqhci.com/library/Crypto/economy-money/En/Joseph-A.Schumpeter-Treatise-on-Money-WordBridge-Publishing%282014%29.pdf" target="_blank">2014, p. 133</a>), traces back to the Irish philosopher George Berkeley, who queried if the money-thing's <em>“true and just idea be not that of a ticket, entitling to power, and fitted to record and transfer such power?”</em> (<a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/4543/pg4543-images.html" target="_blank">1735, query 89</a>). Mirroring this idea, the 18th-century Italian economist Ferdinando Galiani conceptualised the market economy as a <em>"common, open warehouse"</em> (<a href="https://cdn.mises.org/Galiani%20-%20On%20Money.pdf" target="_blank">1751, p. 67</a>) where money is used to <em>“keep an accounting of how much each person labors”</em> (<a href="https://cdn.mises.org/Galiani%20-%20On%20Money.pdf" target="_blank">ibid., p. 68</a>) and contributes to the stockpile. Anyone who brings the fruits of their labor to the public warehouse—analogous to the market—will receive a token of account as acknowledgment of services rendered, which can later be redeemed for services of equivalent value<sup class="footnote" data-footnote="This perspective also brings to light the role of money in organising and allocating resources within a
                market economy — an idea further substantiated by the institutional practices of ancient Mesopotamia. Here,
                money, alongside cuneiform — the earliest known writing system — served as tools with which to administer,
                monitor, and quantify items, activities and obligations (Schmandt-Besserat 1992, Ezzamel and K. Hoskin
                2002).">1</sup>. 

            <p>Thus, through the lens of the accounting view, the money-thing is seen as a continuous ledger, or running account, maintaining a record of the market economy and its actors, documenting contributions and consumptions, and the balance of economic rights that follows. Contesting the textbook triad of money as a medium of exchange, a store of value, and a unit of account, it is perhaps more instructive to think of the money-thing as serving two primary functions, namely that of a medium of exchange and that of an <i>“economy-wide ledger”</i> (<a href="https://www.dl.fiqhci.com/library/Crypto/economy-money/En/Joseph-A.Schumpeter-Treatise-on-Money-WordBridge-Publishing%282014%29.pdf" target="_blank">Schumpeter, 2014, p. 131</a>). As a medium of exchange it facilitates exchange in line with the C–M–C formula, as sellers of commodities receive a right to repayment in kind that they later exercise as buyers. As an economy-wide ledger, it functions as a record-keeping device that chronicles economic activity within a market economy along with the economic rights that follow, rendering so-called commodity money not precursors to bookkeeping systems but rather physical embodiments thereof. Quoting Macleod (<a href="https://books.google.dk/books/about/The_Theory_of_Credit.html?id=TeUoAAAAYAAJ&redir_esc=y" target="_blank">1893</a>, p. 89), the money-thing's function, then, is to <em>“measure, record, and preserve rights for future use; and to transfer them to any one else”</em><sup class="footnote" data-footnote="Similarly, Macleod wrote: 'what is it that is universally required to measure, record, and
                transfer [economic rights]? Some material.'">2</sup>.</p>
            
            <p>This, to be clear, is not merely a restatement of money’s role as a unit of account. Rather, it subsumes that function within a broader claim: that the money-thing serves as the material infrastructure of a social bookkeeping system, one that not only provides the numerical standard through which prices and debts are denominated<sup class="footnote" data-footnote="Contributions must be translated into economic rights that can be exercised against the market. This translation occurs through prices, which express the value that the market — including oneself — attaches to one’s contributions and, in turn, the value it places on those of others.">3</sup>, but also records, preserves, and transfers economic rights within a community.</p>
                
            <p>Also, this is not to deny that the money-thing serves as a store of value. It does, though only as an epiphenomenon of its primary roles, insofar as it enables asynchronous exchange, granting the seller a right to receive goods or services of equivalent value at a later time.</p>

            <p>So, to restate, the money-thing serves a dual role: it functions as a medium of exchange, providing the intermediary step through which one commodity is traded for another, and simultaneously as an abacus-like device, supplying the material substrate upon which economic rights are tallied and ultimately exercised. And while the former has traditionally been assigned pride of place in monetary theory, the latter is no less fundamental. After all, it is the accounting function that renders the money-thing intelligible as a medium of exchange in the first place by providing a common ledger that tracks who has provided what and who is entitled to what in return. Once this accounting dimension is brought to the forefront, the medium-of-exchange role appears not as an independent function but as an application of the underlying record-keeping system.</p>
            
                        <!-- Section: Accounting Principles -->
<h3>ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES</h3>

            <p>Once we start treating money-things as social accounting devices, we must also recognise, first, that all money-things embody some accounting principles, and second, that these principles may vary. Notably, these varying accounting principles are not dictated by the material form of the money-thing<sup class="footnote" data-footnote="Coins, notes, and digital tokens can all be configured to record economic rights in markedly different ways">4</sup> but arise from the institutional rules that govern how money-things, and the rights they incarnate, come into existence. For instance, some accounting systems require every new economic right to be paired with an offsetting obligation, while others permit issuance without such symmetry. The task ahead, therefore, is to bring these differing accounting principles to light and, for expository purposes, to group them into a small number of analytically useful types.</p>
            <p>I here sort accounting principles into three categories, each representing a distinct method of issuing money, that is, increasing the aggregate number of rights to the market's stock of goods and services. I will refer to these as <em>proof-of-work</em>, exemplified by gold; <em>promise-of-work</em>, exemplified by demand deposits; and <em>proof-of-authority</em>, exemplified by currency.</p>

<p>Starting with the former, gold can be seen as an immutable virtual ledger used to document the labor input of individuals and businesses. Naturally scarce, it is obtained only through the arduous process of locating, mining, refining, and transporting the metal. Drawing inspiration from the lexicon of Bitcoin (<a href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf" target="_blank">Nakamoto 2008</a>), we may therefore say that gold is 'issued' as proof-of-work.</p>

<p>By contrast, demand deposits can be viewed as a sophisticated accounting tool rooted in double-entry bookkeeping, which embodies <em>“the balanced and interconnected writing of the equal and opposite signs of credit and debit”</em> (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/0361368286900279" target="_blank">Hoskin, p. 121</a>). Unlike gold, which exclusively preserves a record of labor input, these credit instruments hold a record of promises to work. Issued on the basis of debt, they bind the debtor to undertake income-generating activities within the market economy to meet their payment obligations<sup class="footnote" data-footnote="In a capitalist economy, the debtor is not required to personally exert labor to settle any outstanding
    debt. Instead, she can make money ‘work’ for her through judicious investments or employ wage laborers to
    help expedite debt repayments.">4</sup>, that is, the debtor is bound to contribute services to the marketplace. Thus, under this accounting framework, each money asset (economic right) is offset by a formal debt liability (economic obligation) resulting in a net zero supply. I call this promise-of-work accounting.</p>

<p>Finally, the state, as the sovereign authority, can issue currency through deficit spending. Operating outside the constraints of traditional market principles, the state can lay claim to goods and services provided by individuals and businesses without being required to reciprocate the value in kind. In other words, when the state deficit-spends currency into existence, it does not incur a liability to repay the market<sup class="footnote" data-footnote="Similarly, the modern classical economist Anwar Shaikh (2016, p. 678) writes that 'taxes are payment
    obligations, but they are not “debts” any more than the protection money that restaurateurs pay the Mafia is a
    debt: they are promised nothing in return except a temporary suspension of threat. A debt is a transaction in
    which you promise to return something for something else you are about to receive: it is a repayment obligation'.">5</sup>. Therefore, contrary to the neo-chartalist view that considers currency a liability of the state (<a href="https://www.levyinstitute.org/pubs/wp_792.pdf" target="_blank">See Randal Wray, 2014</a>), it should instead be seen as a form of equity, representing state revenue derived from seigniorage (<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3270860" target="_blank">Bosson et al. 2018</a>). Notably, the state can decide to offset its deficit spending retroactively by levying taxes, effectively backing the issuance of currency with private sector tax liabilities. However, such fiscal adjustment is practically, though not always legally, distinct from the act of issuing currency, which I will refer to as proof-of-authority accounting.</p>

<p>Gold is thus ‘issued’ as a recognition of past labor expended, serving as proof-of-work; demand deposits are issued against the legal obligation of the borrower to labor in the future, effectively functioning as a promise-of-work; and currency is issued by the state through deficit spending, serving as proof-of-authority<sup class="footnote" data-footnote="Notably, this classification bears some resemblances to Gurley and Shaw’s concept of inside and outside
    money. Inside money is an asset backed by a private debt liability and accordingly in net zero supply within
    the private sector, meaning every unit of inside money represents an asset that is offset by a matching liability.
    This strongly correlates with promise-of-work. Outside money, by contrast, is a net asset for the private
    sector, insofar as it is not counterbalanced by private debt liabilities. This roughly correlates with both
    proof-of-work and proof-of-authority accounting.">6</sup>. In light of this, the history of money appears as a rich tapestry of diverse accounting practices that compete and complement each other. Woven into this evolving landscape of competing accounting practices is a deeper struggle over influence and control: Who should set the accounting rules? And who should these rules favor? Different groups have answered these questions in different ways, reflecting not merely technical disputes over record-keeping but broader battles for power, an ongoing contest to define, control, and reshape the architecture of the economy-wide ledger in ways that serve particular interests.</p>

<p>All of this will be addressed in later chapters. For now, however, we must finish the task at hand, which, at present, involves defining how these accounting systems capture economic activity and continuously update to reflect changes in economic rights.</p>

<!-- Section: Payment Methods -->
<h3>PAYMENT METHODS</h3>

<p>Disregarding strict etymological or legal definitions, the money-thing, when seen as an economy-wide ledger, positions payments as the mechanism for recording economic activities along with economic rights. Said differently, it serves as the means by which the ledger is continuously updated and maintained. Framing payments in this way allows us to appreciate their fundamental role not as isolated, self-contained events but as processes within a system that sustains an economy-wide register of economic rights, or, as I also call them, money-relations. Understanding payments thus becomes a matter of central importance.</p>

<p>To begin, paying is an inherently social act involving two parties: a payor and a payee. Each party can be seen as maintaining an economic account that specifies their respective rights. The act of paying involves adjusting these accounts, reflecting the payee’s contribution to the economic process and the payor’s role in its consumption. Insofar as these changes are recorded using a ledger—that is, the money-thing—all forms of money can be understood to conform to the same tripartite payment structure, comprising a payor, a payee, and a ledger (related ideas are found in <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1829655" target="_blank">Hicks 1967</a> and <a href="https://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/samples/cam041/2003043963.pdf" target="_blank">Graziani 2002</a>).</p>

<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 50px; margin-bottom: 50px;">
    <img src="Billeder/Payment structure.png" alt="The Tripartite Payment Structure" width="400px">
</div>

<p>Notably, this triadic relationship is reminiscent of John R. Commons's concept of Authorized Transactions, according to which <em>“a minimum of three persons is required to constitute the social relation of rights and duties – two inferiors and one superior”</em> (<a href="https://historyofeconomicthought.mcmaster.ca/commons/LegalFoundationsCapitalism.pdf" target="_blank">1924, p. 87</a>). While Commons applied this framework to explain formal legal structures, where an institutional authority, say a judge, is needed to uphold rights and responsibilities between two parties, the exchange relation—comprising at least two people and a ledger—exhibits a similar triadic structure. Here, the ledger, or money-thing, operates as the argus-eyed, authoritative third element that mediates exchange and enforces economic rights within the domain of the market. Without such mediating authority, the market economy would devolve into an anarchic state.</p>

<p>Now, within the shared payment structure, a variety of payment techniques are used to record economic activities, and with it, changes in economic rights. Gold, for instance, operates using a single payment method known as <em>assignment</em><sup class="footnote" data-footnote="While the extraction of gold effectively serves as a record of labor expended, it is not here considered an
    act of payment, as it does not involve both a payor and payee.">7</sup>, which involves the direct transfer of gold from the payor to the payee. Here, the tangible movement of gold from one party to another finalises and records the payment, reflecting changes in economic rights.</p>

<p>By contrast, demand deposits make use of four payment types (see <a href="https://books.google.dk/books/about/The_Theory_of_Credit.html?id=TeUoAAAAYAAJ&redir_esc=y" target="_blank">Macleod 1893</a> and <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4032398" target="_blank">Clavero 2022</a>). These are:</p>

<ul style="list-style-type: none; padding-left: 0; font-size: 18px; font-style: italic;">

    <li><strong><em>Payment by Assignment</em></strong>: transferring an asset from payor to payee. The payor loses economic rights as they part with the asset, while the payee gains economic rights as they receive it<sup class="footnote" data-footnote="To avoid any confusion, demand deposits formally constitute a bilateral credit relationship between the bank and the depositor, thereby qualifying as credit de jure. Consequently, payments made using demand deposits primarily serve to update changes in these legally recognised relationships. However, and as previously discussed, this formal credit relationship also embodies the money-relation. In this capacity, payments made using demand deposits serves to update the economy-wide ledger of economic rights and obligations.">8</sup>.</li>
  
    <li>
      <img src="Billeder/Payment by Assignment.png" alt="Payment by Assignment" width="600px" style="margin-top: 50px; margin-bottom: 50px;">
    </li>

    <li><strong><em>Payment by Issuance</em></strong>: creating a new liability, thus expanding the balance sheet of both payor and payee. The payor assumes an economic obligation to repay, while the payee gains an economic right to the output of the market.</li>
  
    <li>
        <img src="Billeder/payment by issuance.png" alt="Payment by Issuance" width="600px" style="margin-top: 50px; margin-bottom: 50px;">
      </li>

    <li><strong><em>Payment by Set-off</em></strong>: canceling out a liability that is owed, thus contracting the balance sheets of both payor and payee. The payor loses economic rights, while the payee is relieved of corresponding economic obligations.</li>
  
    <li>
        <img src="Billeder/Payment by Set-off.png" alt="Payment by Set-off" width="600px" style="margin-top: 50px; margin-bottom: 50px;">
      </li>

    <li><strong><em>Payment by Novation</em></strong>: transferring a liability from payee to payor. The payee’s economic obligation to repay the market is discharged, with the payor assuming this responsibility.
 

  <li>
    <img src="Billeder/Payment by Novation.png" alt="Payment by Novation" width="600px" style="margin-top: 50px; margin-bottom: 50px;">
  </li>
</ul>  
<p>Notably, Payment by Issuance and Payment by Set-off respectively facilitate the extension and contraction of bank credit, that is, the issuance and depletion of money. These operations, which I will refer to as <em>efflux</em> and <em>reflux</em><sup class="footnote" data-footnote="The terminology here employed originates from the seminal work of banking school scholars Thomas Tooke and John Fullarton.">8</sup>, render bank credit a highly elastic accounting system capable of accommodating the economy’s evolving needs to produce, consume, and transact, a topic that will be explored in detail in the next chapter.</p>
    
<p>For present purposes, however, the point is simply this: once money is understood as an economy-wide ledger, payments appear as the procedures through which that ledger is continuously updated. We can now say not only what money is, namely an economic right that exists in and through its material forms, but also how such rights are practically exercised and transfered. Yet this ontological account leaves open a different kind of question: by what criteria do we recognise something as money in the first place? It is to this question that we now turn.</p>
