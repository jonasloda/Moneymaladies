men have come to the conviction that money-values are more real and
substantial than any of the material facts in this transitory world. So much
so that the final purpose of any businesslike undertaking is always a sale,
by which the seller comes in for the price of his goods; and when a person
has sold his goods, and so becomes in effect a creditor by that much, he is
said to have ‘realized’ his wealth, or to have ‘realized’ his holdings. In the
business world the price of things is a more substantial fact than the things
themselves.
